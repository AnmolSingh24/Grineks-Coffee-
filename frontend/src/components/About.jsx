              <p className="text-base opacity-90">
                Grind Geeks was born from a shared love for coffee and a desire to create a space where people could come together over a perfectly brewed cup. Our founders embarked on a journey to source the best beans, master the art of brewing, and build a team of dedicated baristas who share their vision.
